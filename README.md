# Exploratory Bioinformatics Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository documents my capstone research project for the BINF7700 course.
It serves as a central hub for code, notes, analysis workflows, and results developed throughout the term.

## Technical Skills Inventory
Below are the tools and skills I am currently comfortable working with:

- Linux command-line environment
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Python for data analysis and scripting
- R for statistical analysis and data visualization
- RNA-seq analysis workflows
- Sequencing data quality control and assessment
- Use of common bioinformatics tools and pipelines
- Managing project environments with Conda

## Learning Goals for This Course
Through this capstone project, I aim to:

- Develop stronger, more reproducible bioinformatics workflows
- Improve how I document and communicate my work using Markdown and GitHub
- Apply appropriate statistical and biological reasoning to real datasets
- Become more confident in interpreting and presenting results
- Build a research portfolio that reflects real-world academic and industry expectations
